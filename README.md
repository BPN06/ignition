VGL is a graphics library that tries to be way more easier to use than raw vulkan. 

# IMPORTANT

THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. If you want to use have a vulkan graphics library that is actually fully featured, Bevy is probably a better fit. That said, if ever you want to program in vulkan and understand it without having to bother with boilerplate code, have at it.  

# Downloading and building

Just go to my snake_game repo and see how it's done. Vgl is just a simple rust library so I don't think you need I need to go over it too much.
